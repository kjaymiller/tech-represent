# tech-represent

Space given to folks in tech to share what is important to them, not their underrepresentation.

# There are plenty of folks that are from underrepresented groups that are doing awesome things!

Sadly they are often used as the diversity spokesperson for their company and teams.

**This is not a place for that**

**Tech(re)Present** is about showcasing the work and people doing the work. The goal is to show that folks from underrepresented folks have the technical skill that qualifies them. 

Here is the mission statement for this project:

- create a series produced by under-represented groups.
- equip guests with top quality equipment to share what they are doing
- create opportunities for guests to have their projects and skills promoted
- create a system that can be replicated by other content creators to showcase the work of underrepresented folks.
